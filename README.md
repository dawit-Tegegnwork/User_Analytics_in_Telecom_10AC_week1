# Telecom Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze telecom data and provide insights into user behavior, engagement, experience, and satisfaction. The analysis is performed using Python and various data analysis libraries.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
telecom_analysis/
├── data/
│   └── raw_data.csv (This is where you will store the raw data from the SQL database)
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── data_processing.py
│   ├── eda.py
│   ├── database.py
│   └── utils.py
├── notebooks/
│   └── exploratory_analysis.ipynb
├── tests/
│   └── __init__.py
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── setup.py
└── .gitignore
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/telecom-analysis.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the PostgreSQL database connection in `src/database.py` by updating the following variables with your database credentials:

```python
host = "your_host"
database = "your_database"
user = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
```

4. Run the data processing script to fetch and preprocess the data:

```
python src/data_processing.py
```

This will fetch the data from the PostgreSQL database, preprocess it, and save the processed data as `data/processed_data.csv`.

5. Run the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) script:

```
python src/eda.py
```

This script will perform various EDA tasks, such as identifying top handsets, handset manufacturers, user behavior analysis, engagement analysis, and more.

6. Optionally, you can use the `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for additional EDA tasks and visualizations.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, execute the following command:

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It will automatically run the unit tests and perform other checks whenever you push changes to the repository or create a pull request.
